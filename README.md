# Python-Diwali-Sales-Analysis


## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze Diwali sales data to uncover insights about customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and product trends. These insights can help businesses tailor their marketing strategies and improve sales performance in future festive seasons.

## Dataset Used
- The dataset used for this analysis is `Diwali Sales Data.csv`.

## Questions (KPIs)
- What is the distribution of buyers by gender?
- Which age group contributes the most to sales?
- Which states have the highest number of orders and sales?
- What is the relationship between marital status and purchasing behavior?
- Which occupations contribute the most to sales?
- What are the top-selling product categories?
- Which products are the most sold?

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Removed unrelated or blank columns (`Status`, `unnamed1`).
   - Checked for and removed null values.
   - Changed the data type of the `Amount` column to integer.
   - Renamed columns for better readability (e.g., `Marital_Status` to `Shaadi`).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Created visualizations to analyze gender, age group, state, marital status, occupation, and product categories.
   - Used bar charts and grouped data to identify trends and patterns.

3. **Insights Extraction**:
   - Derived actionable insights from the visualizations to understand customer behavior and preferences.

## Dashboard
The analysis includes visualizations such as:
- Gender distribution and sales comparison.
- Age group analysis by sales and orders.
- Top states contributing to sales and orders.
- Marital status and occupation-based purchasing behavior.
- Top-selling product categories and products.

## Project Insights
- Women are the primary buyers, with higher purchasing power compared to men.
- The age group of 26-35 years contributes the most to sales.
- Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka are the top states in terms of orders and sales.
- Married women are the key buyers, especially those working in IT, Healthcare, and Aviation sectors.
- The most sold products are from Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories.

## Final Conclusion
To improve sales during the Diwali season, businesses should focus on targeting married women aged 26-35 years residing in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka. Marketing campaigns should emphasize products in the Food, Clothing, and Electronics categories. Personalized promotions and digital marketing strategies can help capture this key consumer segment effectively.
